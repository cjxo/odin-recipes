		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese
		recipe just like my grandma and mom always made. A simple white sauce
		where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato
		chip crust. This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can
		take one to a pot luck and have the other one to keep in the fridge for
		later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan.
		If you aren't cooking it right away, just keep the topping separate until you
		are ready to put it in the oven.</p>

		<h3>What To Know</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Prep Time: 30 mins</li>
			<li>Cook Time: 45 mins</li>
			<li>Total Time: 1 hr 15 mins</li>
			<li>Servings: 20</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 3/4 pounds whole-wheat macaroni</li>
			<li>3/4 cup butter</li>
			<li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>6 cup milk, divided</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
			<li>3 (8 ounce) package shredded American cheese</li>
			<li>1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (such as Lay'sÂ®), crushed</li>
			<li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
			Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
			occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite,
			8 minutes; drain.</li>
			
			<li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat.
			Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook
			until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour,
			about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture,
			whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds;
			repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture,
			whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder,
			onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with
			salt and black pepper.</li>
			
			<li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it
			begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package
			of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts
			completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and
			the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely
			incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li>
			
			<li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide
			macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
			
			<li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and
			Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato
			chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking
			spray.</li>
			
			<li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the
			sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
